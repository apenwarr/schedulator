# This server-side script connects the Ajax client to the Python daemon.
# This is a minimal man-in-the-middle script.  No input checking from
# either side.

# NOTE: This PHP script does not have the 'p' argument suppot that the Python
# version has.  This means the PHP script can't be used for remote hosting
# where the MobWrite gateway is one one server and the forms are on another.
# Adding this code is easy, but requires a PHP dev environment to debug.
